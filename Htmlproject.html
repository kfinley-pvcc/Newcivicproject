	<h1>What is Privacy</h1>
	<p>Privacy is defined as “the state or condition of being free from being disturbed or observed by other people.” It’s a fundamental human right. The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution even states, “The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things…”</p>

	<h2>The Case for Digital Privacy Against Government Surveillance</h2>
	<p>Privacy is crucial for us human beings to maintain dignity and have freedom of thought and expression without fear. In the time of the Founding Fathers, they likely never could have imagined the amount of surveilling power our government exercises over us today. The technologies of today simply did not exist during that time. Cell phones, social media, the Internet, and the multiple other technologies of today allow the government and other institutions a clear window into our lives. George Orwell’s dystopian masterpiece, <i>1984</i>, was a warning call way ahead of its time about a government that mass surveilled its citizens and used the lack of privacy to control them. Even though the events and characters of <i>1984</i> were fictitious, the theme of the necessity for privacy and protection from surveillance remains pertinent.</p>
	<p>According to the ACLU, “Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act permits the U.S. government to engage in mass, warrantless surveillance of Americans’ international communications, including phone calls, texts, emails, social media messages, and web browsing. The government claims to be pursuing vaguely defined foreign intelligence “targets,” but its targets need not be spies, terrorists, or criminals. They can be virtually any foreigner abroad: journalists, academic researchers, scientists, or businesspeople. And in the course of this surveillance, the government casts a wide net that ensnares the communications of ordinary Americans on a massive scale — in violation of our constitutional rights.”</p>
	<p>The fear of being spied upon is detrimental to our freedoms of thought and expression. Do we, as Americans, truly want to live in a society where every communication of ours can be picked apart to examine and surveil us? A lack of privacy is chilling. The fear of being watched can lead to our own self-censorship in which we censor every thought, leading to a loss of self-expression.<p>
	<h3>How exactly are we surveilled?</h3>
	<p>According to Brown University’s Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs, the scale of mass surveillance in the post-9/11 era is incomprehensibly vast. “While “mass surveillance” is often used to refer to government spying, today it involves a complex grouping of federal agencies, local police, private companies, and even members of the public.” Multiple agencies, institutions, corporations, and individuals use technology against us to surveil us. Anything from emails, text logs, phone calls, and social media is fair game for data harvesting.<p>
	<p>The extreme scope of mass surveillance goes against our fundamental rights ingrained by the Fourth Amendment. Our Fourth Amendment is supposed to protect against unwarranted and unreasonable search and seizure. However, the tools and data used to surveil us, as everyday private citizens, should be something of utmost importance to every American. The lack of protest against this everyday practice is a testament to how desensitized the public has become to this issue.<p>
